# About

- I've read about ~30% of this book before, but mostly glossing over the beginning chapters, and certain sections that were relevant to the current project I was working on at work.
- My aim this time around is to take notes of the bigger picture, and dive deeper into what I'm currently interested in, which is event streaming, data processing, etc.
