## Book notes

- Will not be taking a lot of notes, just the ones that interests me or big ideas
- My note taking style is usually just familiarizing with terms or patterns
- Currently going through all the books I didn't finish and re-visiting them
- My current interests are with event streaming and data processing in distributed systems
  
Current books I own:

|---                                     |    ---|                   ---|                    --- |
| Node.js In Action                      | ?     |  :white_check_mark:  |                        |
| Designing Data Intensive Applications  |~30%   |                      | in progress            |
| Software Architecture, The Hard Parts  | ~30%  |                      | Maybe not so useful    |
| Clean Architecture                     | 0%    |                      |                        |

(I have more books but I'll start with these)

Will be skipping these books that I own:
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (~90% read, and already certified)
- AWS Developer Associate (~30% read, already certified. Book was useless)
