## Node.js In Action - 2nd edition :white_check_mark:

- I read this book about 2-3 years ago (on most sections)
- I revisited it, but selected only parts that are interesting now

Skipped:
- Electron
- Did not bother with chapters I'm familiar with or context-specific (All of the db's, frameworks, etc)
